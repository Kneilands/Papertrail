# Papertrail
AI-powered compliance.

### **Overview**

Papertrail is an AI-powered compliance helper built for small businesses that need to stay on top of their forms, renewals, licenses, and other operational paperwork. The goal is to make compliance easy and automatic, so that business owners donâ€™t miss important deadlines or renewal dates, and can quickly identify the necessary forms or permits to get started.

Papertrail also acts as a simple information hub, helping users learn what regulations apply to them and how to streamline their administrative processes. Over time, I plan to expand it with features like automated reminders, document uploads, and personalized AI guidance based on industry type and location.
